Natural Vs. Artificial: a human-made concept with great utility and horrific consequences.<br><br>

                Claim: <br>
                If humans are natural, then there is no such thing as artificial.<br><br>

                Proof: <br>
                Assume that humans are natural


                By way of contradiction we can prove this. By the definition of artificial we get that <br>
                it is a human-made concept and since human-made things are called "artificial"


Porjects:
Currently, engineering firms spend millions of dollars on dedicated personnel to operate <br>
                    Computer Aided Design (CAD) software and overhead costs on projects, due to the manual labor <br>
                    involved in the earlier stages of the design process using common CAD software (i.e. AutoCAD,
                    Revit, etc.). <br> <br>

                    Projects RARELY finish on budget, again, primarily due to the amount of manual labour that is
                    involved <br>
                    in designing infrastructure with the available CAD software. <br> <br>

                    LICAD is a natural language prompt-based web-application for engineers to iterate quickly through
                    design options <br>
                    in the initial stages of large infrastructure projects, while also providing a platform for
                    stakeholders <br>
                    to wight in on each option in real-time.
                    <br><br>

                    With planed features for vastly more complex structures and constraints, the project stems
                    from a deep drive of contributing <br>
                    to the design and construction of infrastructure on a multi-planetary level for carbon-based-life
                    and machines. <br><br>

                    LICAD is part-one of a three-part project. Part-two is to redesign construction materials, <br>
                    along with their manufacturing processes, with part-three in mind; automate the construction of
                    infrastructure. <br><br>

                    Earthly construction materials and practices are not fit for multiplanetry expansion.<br>
                    Automating the manufacturing process of self-assembling construction components, using native raw
                    materials,<br>
                    can be seen as viable solution, as opposed to solely employing industrial 3D printers.<br><br>

                    With high-level ideas to build bases on the moon to facilitate the exploration of neighboring
                    planets, and <br>
                    perhaps more immediately, build data centres, also on the moon, to offload Earth of their high <br>
                    environmental demand, makes this project a feasible long-term endeavour. If not for fun, for the
                    general benefit of all
                    life on Earth. <br><br>
