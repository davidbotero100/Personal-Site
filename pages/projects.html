                <u>LICAD</u><br><br>
                <p class="indented-text">Large Industrial & Civil Autonomous Design (LICAD) is a system that
                    <br> automates the design of civil infrastructure; from roads, subdivisions, bridges <br> to
                    residential buildings and factories. With planed features for vastly more complex structures,
                    <br>
                    the project stems from a deep drive of contributing to the design and construction of
                    infrastructure
                    <br>
                    on a multi-planetary level for carbon based life and machines. Demo coming soon.
