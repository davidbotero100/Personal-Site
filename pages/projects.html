                <u>LICAD</u><br><br>
                <p class="indented-text">Large Industrial & Civil Autonomous Design (LICAD) is a system that
                    automates the design of civil infrastructure; <br> from roads, subdivisions, bridges to
                    residential buildings, warehouses, and factories. <br><br>
                    With planed features for vastly more complex structures and physical constraints, the project stems
                    from a deep drive of contributing <br>
                    to the design and construction of infrastructure on a multi-planetary level for carbon-based-life
                    and machines. <br><br>

                    LICAD is part-one of a three-part project. Part-two is to redesign construction materials, <br>
                    along with their manufacturing processes, with part-three in mind; automate the construction of
                    infrastructure. <br><br>

                    Earthly construction materials and practices are not fit for multiplanetry expansion.<br>
                    Can you imagine shipping construction materials to the moon?<br>
                    If the goal is to build the most expensive building in the solar system, great.<br><br>








                    <br><br>LICAD demo coming soon.

                <u>The Grassroots Farm Woodfired Pizza App</u><br><br>
                <p class="indented-text">A cross-platform mobile app for the family-owned
                    Grassroots Farm Woodfired Pizza business in Lucknow, ON. <br> <br>

                    Function: Employee hour tracking, integrates with Wave and Square's APIs.<br>
                    Benefits: Saves time for staff, while management can quickly review hours before processing
                    payments.

                    <br><br>
                    Function: Track ingredients used per pizza batch and records the store each batch was sold to <br>
                    Benefits: In the event of an ingredient recall, only the affected inventory is pulled from stores,
                    reducing product loss.
