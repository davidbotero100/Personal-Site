            <p>David is a recent (December 2024) Computer Science graduate and former Civil Engineering

                British Columbia.<br><br>

                Spending most of his time developing personal projects and building products for friends and family, as
                a contractor, <br>
                he thoroughly
                enjoys the entire system design process. From understanding a process and abstracting away <br>
                complex ideas -> to networking with users and stake holders -> to designing, implementing, and deploying
                the
                system. <br>
                <br>

                most of the world's best riding spots with great company.<br><br>

                Other than these, David is just another human who aims to attain fundamental understanding <br>
                to be able to contribute useful and helpful ideas for the long run, and relative benefit, to this <br>
                expression of the universe that we are.
